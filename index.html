        <h1>Welcome to Umar Patel's Website</h1>
        <p>Explore my resume, blog posts, stock insights, and calculator tools.</p>
        <p>For the routine of coffee or juice and reading newsletters and commentary and filings in the morning and talking with clients, coworkers, and friends throughout the day, I would like to be a workaholic in a collaborative environment and then unwind with those very same people at events, outings, and districts, or kick it back with books, movies and cable reruns of Hell’s Kitchen, or sitcoms/shows (Suits, House, etc.) with my roommates, all in the vibrant energy of the city core. I’ll be in my element – work hard, play harder, and set myself up for career success.</p>
